**What is cloud?**

Cloud computing is a technology that allows individuals and businesses to access and store data and applications over the internet instead of on a local computer or server.

**On-Demand Self-Service**

Consumers can automatically provision resources as needed without direct interaction with the cloud service provider. They can access additional compute power, storage, new websites, or database services on demand. This flexibility allows them to expand or reduce services without requiring human assistance from the provider.

**Broad Network Access**

Services are accessible across the network from various devices, including client devices and traditional servers. These cloud-based resources can be accessed via local on-premises networks, the internet, or both, making them potentially globally accessible

**Resource Pooling**

The cloud service provider (CSP) pools resources in a multitenant model and dynamically allocates them on demand, abstracting the specific distribution of hardware from consumers. CSPs manage and optimize network, storage, and compute capabilities, ensuring consumers can access these resources without knowing or caring about their physical locations, which may change with each use.

**Rapid Elasticity**

Resources in cloud computing are provisioned and released to match demand, either automatically or manually. Unlike traditional capital expenditures for fixed server resources, cloud-based resources are dynamically allocated, ensuring efficient utilization. This is especially beneficial for businesses with fluctuating resource needs, such as retail with seasonal demand spikes, as they no longer need to purchase and maintain underutilized servers.

**Measured Service**

Cloud service providers (CSPs) meter resource utilization, enabling efficient and dynamic allocation. This metering allows CSPs to accurately bill consumers for the exact amount of resources consumed.

**Cloud Components and Clients**
There are three main components in a cloud services solution. The first component is the client platform from which the cloud services are being accessed. The second is the data center where the cloud services are being hosted. The final component is the network connection between those two points.

Cloud Service Component  Role

CSP data center          Hosts cloud services

Client                   Means of access to cloud services for consumer

Network                  Path between cloud services and client devices

Leading cloud service providers like Microsoft and Amazon operate extensive global networks of data centers. These facilities are engineered with redundancy to ensure continuous power supply, internet connectivity, and physical security. Within these data centers, cloud services are hosted, offering diverse functionalities.

Cloud services cater to a broad spectrum of users, including individuals and businesses, across various platforms. These services encompass storage, email, e-commerce, office suites, and development environments. Users access these services from devices such as phones, tablets, computers, IoT devices, and servers, running operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.

Cloud infrastructure can be managed internally by an organization or outsourced to a CSP that serves multiple clients. Hybrid solutions combine these approaches. Network connections linking client devices to CSP data centers can be private, public via the internet, or cellular, tailored to specific organizational needs.

Deployment models include:

**Public Cloud**: Managed by a CSP, serving external customers who share resources.

**Private Cloud**: Dedicated to a single organization, offering enhanced control and privacy.

**Hybrid Cloud**: Combines public, private, or community deployments to optimize flexibility and performance based on varying needs.

**Public Cloud**

The public cloud is a comprehensive set of hardware, networking, storage, services, applications, and interfaces managed by third-party providers for use by businesses and individuals. Customers access these services via subscription models, paying for usage rather than owning physical infrastructure.

Cloud service providers (CSPs) create scalable data centers that abstract underlying infrastructure details from consumers. Resources are dynamically allocated to meet current demand, offering flexibility and scalability. Public clouds provide extensive options for computing, storage, and specialized services like GPUs for data science and application development.

Public cloud offerings include APIs, security features, and specialized infrastructure tailored to diverse workload requirements. While typically multi-tenant, some providers offer dedicated instances for customers needing physical isolation due to governance or compliance requirements, though this may not yield the same cost savings as multi-tenancy.

Major public cloud vendors like Amazon and Microsoft are synonymous with cloud computing, although they also provide private cloud deployment options alongside their public offerings.

**Private Cloud**

A private cloud is a dedicated set of hardware, networking, storage, services, applications, and interfaces owned and operated by an organization for exclusive use by its employees, partners, or customers. It can be managed internally or by a third party solely for one enterprise, providing complete control over deployment while leveraging cloud benefits. This model is favored by large enterprises seeking stringent control, governance, security, and compliance, operating behind a firewall and not accessible to the public.

Public cloud vendors are increasingly offering on-premises appliances that mirror their cloud services, installed within customer data centers behind firewalls. These appliances provide scalability, cost-efficiency, and cloud advantages while maintaining data on-site. The deployment model may involve vendor-managed appliances billed like public cloud services, or customer-owned appliances for greater control and maintenance.

This approach addresses security concerns and regulatory requirements that may restrict the use of public cloud, such as in industries like banking where data confidentiality is critical.

<summary> Hybrid Cloud </summary>
<br

A hybrid cloud environment combines private cloud infrastructure with public cloud services, integrating them to address business needs effectively. The goal is to create a unified, automated, and well-managed computing environment where end-users seamlessly access technology services without distinguishing between on-premises and cloud resources.

Multicloud refers to using multiple public cloud services within an organization. Initially driven by different teams or units adopting various public clouds, multicloud environments require management for visibility, control, and operational efficiency across platforms.

Corporate computing involves integrating multiple public services with private clouds and data centers to enhance overall computing capabilities. Not all mixed cloud usage scenarios qualify as hybrid or multicloud environments:

**Not Hybrid/Multicloud**:

Using a public cloud service for isolated development without integration with private cloud or data center.
Utilizing a SaaS application without data movement to internal data centers.
Standardizing different divisions on separate public clouds without inter-cloud operations.

**Hybrid/Multicloud**:

Integrating public development platforms that exchange data with private cloud or data center applications.
Leveraging SaaS applications that interact with private or data center resources.
Designing business processes as services to connect multiple cloud environments seamlessly.
Ingesting data from various cloud sources into a SaaS analytics platform.
Flexibly moving workloads across public clouds based on cost or performance considerations.

<summary> Cloud Within a Cloud (Virtual Private Cloud) </summary>
<br

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), also known as Cloud Within a Cloud, involves hosting an organization's cloud services within a public cloud provider's infrastructure but in an isolated segment. This segment ensures that the organization's resources are private and not shared with other companies, while the public cloud environment provides scalability and flexibility.

**Key points about Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**:

Definition: A VPC is a logical isolation of cloud services within a public cloud provider's infrastructure.

Isolation: Resources are segregated to ensure privacy and security, though they reside within a public cloud.

Administration: The organization retains full administrative control and responsibility over its VPC resources.

Scalability: VPCs leverage the scalability of the public cloud infrastructure, accommodating varying resource demands.

Comparison with Private Cloud: Differs from a private cloud, which involves physical isolation in a dedicated data center or infrastructure, potentially limiting scalability compared to VPCs.

Virtual Private Clouds are examples of single-tenant deployments within a public cloud setting, offering organizations both the benefits of public cloud scalability and the privacy of dedicated resources.

**Multitenancy**:
Multitenancy is the model used in public cloud deployments where multiple consumers, known as tenants, share computing resources managed by a CSP. This shared resource utilization contrasts with VPC deployments where resources are isolated for individual organizations. Multitenancy enables cost benefits through efficient resource sharing among multiple users within the same cloud infrastructure.

**Multi-cloud**:
Multi-cloud refers to various configurations where organizations use services from multiple public cloud providers (such as AWS and Azure) and possibly from a private cloud infrastructure. This approach reduces dependence on a single vendor, enhances service flexibility and choice, allows better control over data geographic location, and improves disaster mitigation capabilities.
